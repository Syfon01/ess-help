Emergency Safety Solutions (ESS) is the brainchild of roadside safety advocates who 
are deeply troubled by the high number of preventable, and often fatal, car accidents 
that occur every day around the world. ESS has taken the lead on analyzing and documenting
roadway fatality data published by the National Highway Transportation Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) and other global government agencies, to identify the root causes 
of crash trends that have previously gone unidentified. We strive to develop new 
strategies and technologies to prevent future accidents that would fall under these 
safety cases.
