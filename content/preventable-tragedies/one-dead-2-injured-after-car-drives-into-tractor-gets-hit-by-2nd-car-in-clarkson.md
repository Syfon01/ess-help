title: One dead, 2 injured after car drives into tractor, gets hit by 2nd car in Clarkson
---


A Hamlin woman is dead and two other people are injured after a car ran into a farm tractor in Clarkson and was subsequently hit by another car Tuesday evening.

Monroe County Sheriffâ€™s deputies said they were called about a crash on Redman Road approximately two miles north of State Route 104.

Deputies who arrived on scene said a car driving north on Redman Road slammed head-on into a tractor on the north shoulder of the road, facing south, that was partially blocking the lane while loading heavy equipment. After the car hit the tractor, it spun into the southbound lane and crashed into a second vehicle.

While loading the equipment, deputies determined the tractor had its emergency and hazard lights on and was well lit.
