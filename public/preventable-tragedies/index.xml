      <description>A Pennsylvania woman and child are dead after a crash in Sussex County early Wednesday morning. State police were called to the crash on Interstate 95 at mile marker 25 around 4:20 a.m. Troopers on scene determined a sedan and a tractor-trailer were involved.
Investigators say the driver of the sedan experienced mechanical problems and stopped in the right lane of travel without turning on the hazards. While stopped, a tractor-trailer hit the vehicle from behind, pushing it onto the shoulder.</description>
